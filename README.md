This is simple 2D robot simulator which was forked from the code for Clint Liddick's [Intro to Robotics](http://www.clintonliddick.com/articles/intro-to-robotics-part-1/) series.

To install dependencies run:

```bash
cd robotics_intro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or install a development version of the package:

```bash
pip install -e alvin
```

Execute directly from the command line:

```bash
alvin.py
```
